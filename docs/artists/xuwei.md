?> In 1995, Xu Wei's song "Persistence" was sung by singer Tian Zhen, and he had the opportunity to sign a contract with Red Star Production to publish his debut album "Elsewhere", which immediately caused a sensation and sold 500,000 copies without any promotion. In recent years, Xu Wei has been active in the singing world, not only releasing his own music works, but also not forgetting to send good songs to the singing world, and in 1998, as one of the only two authors in the pop music industry, his works were selected into the Chinese contemporary poetry anthology together with Cui Jian.

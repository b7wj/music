?> My little airport is a boy and a girl music group. P and Nicole were in the same class (Hong Kong Shue Yan University, Department of Journalism and Communication) and met through a singing competition. Nicole likes to eat bananas; P likes to use the simplest of casio keyboards to make cute, quirky sounds like children's voices. On their debut album, "A walk at the zoo is the thing to do", they use guitars, small electric piano and vocals as pens to record a memory. Each song starts with a person's name, and is written for a lost friend from the past, using the memory of the past to cherish the present.

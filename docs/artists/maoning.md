?> Chinese famous male singer, known as the prince of love songs in the mainland. Born in Shenyang in 1969, he signed a contract with Guangzhou New Era Video Company in 1990 and released his classic song "The Sound of the Wave Remains the Same". This song soon spread to the north and south of the country, making Mao Ning one of the most popular male singers in China. In 1992, he released the popular golden song "Blue Blue Night, Blue Blue Dream", which again established his status as a first-line star in the domestic singing industry and became a well-deserved singing superstar. Mao Ning sang a number of classic popular songs with the then equally popular mainland singer Yang Yuying.

?> Chuanzi is a native of the southern part of Beijing. In his early years, he suffered a lot in prison for fighting and brawling. At the end of 2007, Lu Zhongqiang, the boss of Thirteen Moon, discovered the singer by chance and signed him to the label after many conversations, drunkenness, and live performances, starting Chuanzi's official musical journey and setting up the Hopeful Music label together. In August 2010, he participated in the "China's Got Talent" produced by Eastern TV and sang the song "Human Ghost Love" with Dodo (who has been with Chuanzi for 11 years), which moved the audience and the judges.
